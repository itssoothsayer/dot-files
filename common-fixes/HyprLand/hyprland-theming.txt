#First copy your gtk-3.0 and gtk-4.0 files to /usr/share/themes /usr/share/icons and to ~/.themes ~/.icons

#To make the icons theme (mouse cursor) behave consistently
#make a default directory if not there then do the following

nano index.theme
[Icon Theme]
Inherits=Bibata-Modern-Ice

#save and exit
#now you can change the theme from nwg-look
