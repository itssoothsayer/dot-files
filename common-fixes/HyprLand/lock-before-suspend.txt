Goal: Automatically lock the screen when the system suspends or resumes using Hyprlock and Hypridle in Hyprland.

1. Ensuring Hyprlock Locks Screen on Suspend

    Hyprlock is a screen locking tool that can lock your screen when triggered.
    Hypridle can handle idle time to trigger Hyprlock after a set period of inactivity.

What We Did:

    We discussed ensuring that Hyprlock locks the screen when the system goes to sleep (suspend).
    This is handled either manually (by running hyprlock) or automatically through a systemd service.

2. Locking Screen on Suspend with Systemd

    Systemd services were set up to run Hyprlock automatically before the system suspends and after it resumes.

Steps to Lock on Suspend:

    Create a systemd service to lock the screen before suspend:
        This ensures that Hyprlock locks the screen before the system enters suspend mode.
	
	[Unit]
	Description=Lock screen before suspend
	Before=sleep.target
		
	[Service]
	Type=oneshot
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/hyprlock
	User=<your-username>

	[Install]
	WantedBy=sleep.target
	
Save this as /etc/systemd/system/hyprlock-suspend.service.

Enable the service to ensure it runs on suspend: sudo systemctl enable hyprlock-suspend.service


3. Locking Screen on Resume (Optional)

    After suspending, it might be useful to lock the screen again immediately upon resuming from suspend.
    Locking on resume ensures that after the system wakes up, your screen is immediately locked, enhancing security.

Steps to Lock on Resume:

    Create a systemd service to lock the screen after resume:
        This runs Hyprlock as soon as the system wakes up from suspend.


	[Unit]
	Description=Lock screen after resume
	After=suspend.target

	[Service]
	Type=oneshot
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/hyprlock
	User=<your-username>
	Environment=DISPLAY=:0  # Only for X11; omit if on Wayland (Hyprland)

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

    Save this as /etc/systemd/system/hyprlock-resume.service.

Enable the service to ensure it runs after resume: sudo systemctl enable hyprlock-resume.service
This will ensure Hyprlock runs immediately after resume and locks your screen.

Final Check: Test and Confirm

    Test the lock on suspend:
        Suspend the system: systemctl suspend.
        Check if Hyprlock locks the screen as expected before the system goes into suspend.

    Test the lock on resume:
        Resume from suspend: Check if Hyprlock locks the screen immediately after waking up.
