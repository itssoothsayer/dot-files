#Download the sddm package and uwsm package if you want to use uwsm
#To autostart sddm and uswm
sudo systemctl enable sddm 
sudo systemctl enable uswm

#If you want to start the sddm right now (it will log you out)  
sudo systemctl start sddm
#Download the sddm theme example:
yay -S sddm-astronaut-theme

#Go the the sddm theme directory
cd /usr/share/sddm/themes

#It should show something like this
usr/share/sddm/themes🔒 
❯ ls
catppuccin-mocha  elarun  maldives  maya  sddm-astronaut-theme	sugar-dark

#So lets say you want to apply sddm-astronaut-theme, go to the directory 
cd /etc/sddm.conf.d

#if not create it and edit the file
sudo nano /etc/sddm.conf.d/theme.conf  

#Should look like this
[Theme]
Current=sddm-astronaut-theme

#And you are done. Also in the usr/share/sddm/themes/sddm-astronaut-theme directory you can change the theme style by running the setup.sh script.
